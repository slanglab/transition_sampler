some commands

  ./parsetext.sh unsolicited.txt
  ./parsetext.sh cassidy.txt
  ./parsetext.sh examples/cohn.txt

view whole-structure statistics.  (um, --tlen is ignored??)
  python higher.py -v --tlen 1 ../examples/pf1.txt.conllu ../examples/pf1.txt.pred

view per-edge, or per-path, marginals.
  python parsemar/higher.py -v --edgepred --tlen 2 cassidy.txt.conllu cassidy.txt.pred 

note that you're supposed to give the gold standard as the second arg if you
care about prec/rec ranking or brier scores or whatever.

however if no gold, just give it the greedy prediction as the "gold" and it
will run. try to ignore the "gold" info in the printout then.
